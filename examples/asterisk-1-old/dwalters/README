  Follow the instructions below to download and install the Digium G.729
  Software Codec for Asterisk.



==[ Installation Overview ]===================================================

  Once you have a G.729 license key, there are four primary tasks to perform
  in order to install the G.729 software codec.

      1)  Download and execute the 'register' utility to generate a valid
          license.

      2)  Download and execute the 'benchg729' utility to determine the
          optimum build.

      3)  Use the 'G.729 Selector' web utility to determine the recommended
          G.729 codec binary download package.

      4)  Download and install the 'codec_g729' binary that is built for your
          platform.

  The steps to complete these tasks are described in the Installation
  Procedure section.

  The register utility may be downloaded from:
  http://downloads.digium.com/pub/register

  The benchg729 utility may be downloaded from:
  http://downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony/codec_g729/benchg729

  The G.729 Selector may be viewed from:
  http://www.digium.com/en/docs/G729/g729-download.php

  The G.729 codec binary may be downloaded from:
  http://downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony/codec_g729

  Notes:

  - Supported software builds are provided for 32-bit and 64-bit x86
    platforms, and are optimized for a variety of processor types. Choose the
    directory that closest matches your Asterisk version and processor
    type. Each of these directories contains codec TAR files which include
    the G.729 codec binary for each type of supported processor.

  - The register utility and G.729 codec binaries for additional processor
    types and operating systems may be found in the unsupported directory.



==[ Installation Procedure ]==================================================

1)  Download and execute the register utility to generate a valid license.

1.1)  Download the register utility to the root home directory of your
      Asterisk server. First, log in as the user "root".

      Command-line Example for 32-bit Linux:

        # cd /root
        # wget http://downloads.digium.com/pub/register/x86-32/register

1.2)  Change the permissions of the /root/register file to r-x------.

      Command-line Example:

        # chmod 500 /root/register

1.3)  Run the register utility and follow the interactive instructions. The
      registration utility will prompt you for your G.729 license key.

      Command-line Example:

        # /root/register

      Notes:

      - Internet access is required from your Asterisk server in order to
        register your G.729 key for licensed use. Outgoing network traffic to
        TCP port 443 (SSL) must be allowed in order for the register utility
        to successfully communicate with Digium's license server and complete
        the registration process.


2)  Download and execute the benchg729 utility to determine the optimum build.

    There are various optimized versions of the G.729 codec binary available
    for different CPU types in both x86-32 and x86-64 architectures. To
    determine which build of the module performs best on your system, the
    benchg729 utility will run a series of tests, and report which codec
    module will maximize encoding performance on your system.

    NOTE: Using the x86-32 version on an x86-64 system may return useless
    results. Be sure to select the proper version for your architecture.

2.1)  Download the benchg729 utility to the root home directory of your
      Asterisk server.

      Command-line Example for 32-bit Linux:

        # cd /root
        # wget http://downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony/codec_g729/\
          benchg729/x86-32/benchg729

2.2)  Change the permissions of the /root/benchg729 file to r-x------.

      Command-line Example:

        # chmod 500 /root/benchg729

2.3)  Run the benchg729 utility and record the build that it recommends should
      be used for your platform.

      Command-line Example:

        # /root/benchg729


3)  Use the 'G.729 Selector' web utility to determine the recommended G.729
    codec binary download package.

    Depending upon your version of Asterisk and processor architecture,
    different G.729 codec binaries are recommended for the use of G.729.
    Digium provides a G.729 Selector web utility in order to assist with
    choosing the correct G.729 codec binary. The G.729 Selector web utility
    should be viewed with a standard web browser and may be accessed via the
    following URL:

    http://www.digium.com/en/docs/G729/g729-download.php

    The file that the G.729 Selector web utility informs you is recommended
    for your platform should be the file that you use in place of the examples
    provided in step 4 of this section.


4)  Download and install the codec_g729 binary that is built for your
    platform.

    There are different versions of the G.729 codec binary for various
    Asterisk releases:  There are two versions for Asterisk 1.8.x point
    releases (one for 1.8.0 through 1.8.3, another for 1.8.4 and following);
    there is a single version for 10.x (10.0) and a single version for 11.x
    (11.0). Take note that these modules are *not* loadable in prior releases
    of Asterisk, and will only load in the specific version for which they are
    designed. Be sure that you download the correct version of the G.729
    codec binary for your Asterisk version, as recommended by the G.729
    Selector web utility in step 3.

    In addition, updated builds of the G.729 codec binary are frequently
    released. Each build has a 'version number'. This version number is part
    of the filename, and is also included in the copyright/license message
    that is displayed when the module is loaded into Asterisk. In this
    document, build number '3.1.2' has been used as an example. Keep in mind
    that the current build number may be newer when you read this document.

4.1)  Download G.729 to the root home directory of your Asterisk server,
      replacing 'pentium4m' in the example with the recommended build and
      '_32' in the example with your CPU architecture.

      Command-line Example for 32-bit Linux:

        # cd /root
        # wget http://downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony/codec_g729/\
          asterisk-1.8.4/x86-32/codec_g729a-1.8.4_3.1.5-pentium4m_32.tar.gz

4.2)  Expand the codec_g729 archive and copy the codec_g729a.so file to the 
      /usr/lib/asterisk/modules directory.

      Command-line Example for 32-bit Linux:

        # tar xzvf codec_g729a-1.8.4_3.1.5-pentium4m_32.tar.gz
        # cp /root/codec_g729a-1.8.4_3.1.5-pentium4m/codec_g729a.so /usr/lib\
          /asterisk/modules

4.3)  The G.729 codec binary must be loaded in order to initialize your new
      G.729 licensed channels. (See General Notes to use multiple licenses on
      one server.)

      Command-line Example for new installs:

        # asterisk -rx "module load codec_g729a.so"

      Command-line Example for a codec_g729 upgrade:

        # asterisk -rx "module reload codec_g729a.so"

4.4)  Verify that the number of G.729 licensed channels available to Asterisk
      matches the number of G.729 licensed channels that you purchased. This
      can be verified by issuing "g729 show licenses" in the Asterisk CLI.
      Take into consideration any previous G.729 licensed channels that you
      had already registered to your Asterisk server before verifying this
      number.

      Command-line Example:

        # asterisk -rvvv
        *CLI> g729 show licenses
        0/0 encoders/decoders of 26 licensed channels are currently in use

        Licenses Found:
        Key: G729-EXAMPLE1 -- Host-ID: ex:am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0:ex:
        am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0 -- Channels: 2 (Expires: 2026-09-26) (OK)
        Key: G729-EXAMPLE2 -- Host-ID: ex:am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0:ex:
        am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0 -- Channels: 24 (Expires: 2026-09-26) (OK)


5)  Copy the generated license files to a safe place as described in the
    Backup Procedure section.



==[ Backup Procedure ]========================================================

  It is extremely important that you backup all of the files located in the
  /var/lib/asterisk/licenses directory. This directory contains the Host-ID
  specific license files for your system. These license files are tied to the
  MAC address of all the ethernet devices installed in your system. Creating a
  backup of this directory will allow you to restore your G.729 license file
  in case you need to reinstall your operating system. This will help prevent
  the need to contact Digium to request authorization to increment your G.729
  key and from needing to purchase a new G.729 key if you exceed the maximum
  number of G.729 key increments allowed.



==[ General Notes ]===========================================================

  -  Multiple G.729 keys may be registered to the same Asterisk server. This
     will allow you to increase the total number of available G.729 licensed
     channels on your Asterisk server. New G.729 keys may be registered to
     your Asterisk server using the same instructions provided in the
     Installation Procedure section. There will be an additional G.729 license
     file generated in the /var/lib/asterisk/licenses directory for each G.729
     key that is successfully registered to your Asterisk server. It is
     extremely important that you follow the instructions provided in Backup
     Procedure section whenever a new G.729 key is successfully registered to
     your Asterisk server.

  -  A G.729 key must be re-registered if any of the Ethernet devices in your
     Asterisk server are changed, added, or removed. The unique G.729 license
     file which is located in your /var/lib/asterisk/licenses directory is
     tied to the MAC address of all the Ethernet devices installed in your
     system. A G.729 key can only be re-registered once without authorization
     from Digium. Digium must be contacted by phone in order to request
     authorization to have your G.729 key incremented. Digium reserves the
     right to deny authorization for having a G.729 key incremented.

  -  The silence suppression feature is not available using the codec_g729a.so
     file. Asterisk will generate output similar to "Dropping extra frame of
     G.729 since we already have a VAD frame at the end" if the remote end is
     attempting to use silence suppression with G.729. Consult with the remote
     end to ensure that silence suppression is not being used. You may have
     problems using G.729 if the remote end attempts to use silence
     suppression.

  -  It is not required or suggested to specify a load line in the
     /etc/asterisk/modules.conf for the codec_g729a.so file. Asterisk will
     automatically load it using the autoload option. The autoload option is
     set on by default.



==[ Asterisk CLI Commands ]===================================================

  The G.729 codec binary provides the following Asterisk CLI commands:

  "g729 show hostid"
  "g729 show licenses"
  "g729 show version"

  These are explained in greater detail below.
  
  -  Issuing "g729 show hostid" on the Asterisk CLI will display the system's
     Host-ID.

     Command-line Example:

       # asterisk -rvvv
       *CLI> g729 show hostid
       Host-ID: ex:am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0

  -  Issuing "g729 show licenses" on the Asterisk CLI will display all G.729
     licenses and their utilization.

     Command-line Example:

       # asterisk -rvvv
       *CLI> g729 show licenses
       0/0 encoders/decoders of 26 licensed channels are currently in use

       Licenses Found:
       Key: G729-EXAMPLE1 -- Host-ID: ex:am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0:ex:a
       m:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0 -- Channels: 2 (Expires: 2026-09-26) (OK)
       Key: G729-EXAMPLE2 -- Host-ID: ex:am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0:ex:a
       m:pl:e0:ex:am:pl:e0 -- Channels: 24 (Expires: 2026-09-26) (OK)

  -  Issuing "g729 show version" on the Asterisk CLI will display the G.729
     codec binary version.

     Command-line Example:

       # asterisk -rvvv
       *CLI> g729 show version
       Digium G.729A Module Version 1.8.4_3.1.5 (optimized for pentium4m_32)



==[ AMI Actions ]=============================================================

  The G.729 codec binary provides the following AMI actions:

  "G729LicenseList"
  "G729LicenseStatus"

  These are explained in greater detail below.

  -  Issuing the "G729LicenseList" AMI action will display all G.729 licenses
     and their loading status.

     AMI Example:

       Action: G729LicenseList

       Response: Success
       Message: License list will follow

       Event: G729License
